# Welcome to Minh Ngoc Le's Pages

I am a graduate student in Astrophysics. 

Last name: Le, middle name: Minh, first name: Ngoc. 
In Vietnamese: **Lê Minh Ngọc**

Vietnamese's name is written in order: last name + middle name + first name.  We call others by their first names, that's why I prefer people to call me by my first name  _"Ngoc"_ 

(pronounce: _ŋok_, with _"ŋ"_ likes _"ng"_ in the word _"sing"_).

## Education

- BSc. in Physics, The University of Science - Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City;
- MSc. in Astronomy (expected), National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.
