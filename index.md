# Welcome to Minh Ngoc Le's Page

I am a graduate student in Astrophysics who interested in the dark components of the universe. 

My full name is (in Vietnamese) **Lê Minh Ngọc**. Vietnamese's name is written in order: last name + middle name + first name.  We call others by first names, that's why I prefer people to call me _"Ngoc"_ (pronounce: _ŋok_, with _"ŋ"_ as _"ng"_ in the word _"sing"_) or you can find how to pronounce it [here](https://forvo.com/user/ngocle0915/).

## Education

- BSc. in Physics, The University of Science - Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City;
- MSc. in Astronomy (expected), National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.

## CV
More about my background study, academic activities (schools, workshops, conferences,...) can be found in [my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xefyu0NrpB174s0iomoqaOheHzOX4cFE/view?usp=sharing).

## In my free time

- I enjoy singing and playing my Ukulele (which named _"Erling"_, means _"tweenty"_).
- As a typical dog person, I love to spend my free time with dogs.
- I also love writing - to store my thought, experience and what I learned from open courses. As a graduate student who usually struggles with academic problems, I have been collecting knowledge and experience from senior people to cope with these issues. In the beginning, I just wanted to write things down for myself. However, I felt that may be helpful for other students who are facing obstacles like I did. Therefore, I would like to share what I collected, especially about how to self-motivate and to strengthen mental health under academic pressure, in [this blog](https://life-of-a-grad-student.blogspot.com/).
