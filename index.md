# Welcome to Minh Ngoc Le's Page

I am a graduate student in Astrophysics who interested in the dark components of the universe. 

My full name is (in Vietnamese) **Lê Minh Ngọc**. Vietnamese's name is written in order: last name + middle name + first name.  We call others by first names, that's why I prefer people to call me _"Ngoc"_ (pronounce: _ŋok_, with _"ŋ"_ as _"ng"_ in the word _"sing"_) or you can find how to pronounce it [here](https://forvo.com/user/ngocle0915/).

## Research

![Image](How can we see.png)

My research interests focus on the nature of _Dark Matter_ and _Dark Energy_ , which are dominant components of the universe: _Dark Energy_ contributes on the expanding of universe and _Dark Matter_ gravitationally interacts with baryonic matter to form the structure we see nowadays. My current research focuses on using dark matter halos correlation functions to understand our universe on large scales (Large-Scale Structure).  

## Education

- BSc. in Physics, The University of Science - Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City;
- MSc. in Astronomy (expected), National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. 

## CV
More about my background study, academic activities (schools, workshops, conferences,...) can be found in [my CV](Minh_Ngoc_LE_CV.pdf)

## In my free time

- I enjoy singing and playing my Ukulele (which named _"Erling"_, means _"tweenty"_ since I brought _him_ home on the last day of 2020, in my 20s year-old).
- As a typical dog person, I love playing with dogs and can spend hours talking to them.
- I also love writing - which I call _"talking to myself"_ - to store my thought, experience and what I learned from open courses. As a graduate student who usually struggles with academic problems, I have been collecting knowledge and experience from senior people to cope with these issues. In the beginning, I just wanted to write things down for myself. However, I felt that may be helpful for other students who are facing obstacles like I did. Therefore, I would like to share what I collected, especially about how to self-motivate and to strengthen mental health under academic pressure, in [this blog](https://life-of-a-grad-student.blogspot.com/).
