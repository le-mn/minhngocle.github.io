# Welcome to Minh Ngoc Le's Page

I am a graduate student in Astrophysics who interested in the dark components of the universe. 

My name contains last name: _Le_, middle name: _Minh_ and first name: _Ngoc_. 
In Vietnamese: **Lê Minh Ngọc**.

Vietnamese's name is written in order: last name + middle name + first name.  We call others by first names, that's why I prefer people to call me _"Ngoc"_ (pronounce: _ŋok_, with _"ŋ"_ as _"ng"_ in the word _"sing"_).

## Education

- BSc. in Physics, The University of Science - Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City;

## In my free time

- I enjoy singing and playing my Ukulele (which named _"Erling"_, means _"tweenty"_).
- As a _"normal"_ dog person, I love to spend my free time with dogs.
- As a graduate student who usually struggles with academic problems, I have been collecting knowledge and experience from senior people to cope with these issues. In the beginning, I just wanted to write things down for myself. However, I felt that may be helpful for other students who are facing obstacles like I did. Therefore, I decided to write this blog [https://life-of-a-grad-student.blogspot.com/] and would like to share what I learned and experienced, especially about how to improve study/research efficiency and to strengthen mental health under academic pressure.
