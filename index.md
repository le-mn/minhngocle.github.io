## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/le-mn/minhngocle.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Last name: Le, middle name: Minh, first name: Ngoc. 
In Vietnamese: Lê Minh Ngọc
Vietnamese's name is written in order: last name + middle name + first name.  In my country, people always call others by their first names, that's why I prefer people to call me by my first name  "Ngoc" 
(pronounce: ŋok, with "ŋ" likes "ng" in the word "sing").

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/le-mn/minhngocle.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
